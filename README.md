# T-SURE: Uncertainty-Aware Survival Prediction with Transductive Learning for Clinical Decision Support

**T-SURE** is a transductive survival ranking model with an integrated *rejection option* for prognosis tasks.  
It enables learning from both labeled and unlabeled samples while explicitly modeling uncertainty and abstaining from unreliable predictions.  
T-SURE is applied to multiple cancer types and modalities including whole-slide images (WSI), gene expression, pathology reports, and clinical data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To recreate the environment, use the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tsure_env
```

## üöÄ How to Run the Model
All main scripts allow selection of modality (modality) and cancer type (cancer) using variables at the top of the script.
Example values:
```bash
modality = 'Gene'     # Options: 'WSI', 'Gene', 'Reports', 'Clinical'
cancer = 'BRCA'       # Options: BLCA, BRCA, CSEC, COAD, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, LUAD, STAD, UCEC
```

| `Run_TSURE.py`                     | Runs T-SURE on bootstrap samples. Plots rejection curves, Kaplan-Meier survival plots, and gene heatmaps.       |
| `Run_Comparison.py`                | Compares T-SURE with baseline models (CoxPH, GBM, SVM, etc.) using cross-validation.                            |
| `Run_DataEfficiency_Experiment.py` | Tests label efficiency: trains T-SURE and baseline models on subsets of training data and compares performance. |
